# Brix

A build-system toolkit: define build graphs in ordinary Python while the
engine handles planning, dependency inference, and parallel execution.

**The long game:** prototype everything in Python first to stabilize the
functionality and the API. Then move the engine internals to Rust (PyO3), so
the same core can later back a JavaScript/TypeScript API. Python stays the
user-facing build language.

> This README is the hand-off document *and* the spec. A fresh session should
> be able to read this file plus [docs/build-layers.html](docs/build-layers.html)
> and continue the work. It is updated at every commit — especially the TODO
> list and the Completed log.

## Start here

1. This file — vision, spec, current state, and the TODO list.
2. [docs/build-layers.html](docs/build-layers.html) — the agreed design for
   the next phase (incremental / cache / atomic layers). Open in a browser;
   it has class and data-flow diagrams.

## Current state

Minimal prototype (spec steps 1–10 plus dependency inference), the
build-layer seams, and the full IncrementalBuilder (fingerprint skip +
deleted-source cleanup) are implemented and working. 60 tests pass.

- Logical data expressions: `file`, `glob`, `regex`, `tool`, `value`, unions
- `Graph.add(...)` with generic `ExternalProcessAction` (`name` is optional;
  label falls back to the command line)
- Lazy command-line placeholder rendering (only placeholders referenced in
  `command_line` are rendered)
- Dependency inference from data-set intersections (conservative overlap)
- Graph-shaped `ExecutionPlan` with a parallel thread-pool scheduler
- `ExpandAll` as an unrealized plan node, expanded at runtime — including
  over collections produced by generator actions during the same build
- Structured `ProcessResult`s (stdout/stderr/exit/signal); failure cascades
  skip downstream nodes; cycle detection
- `CleanBuilder(graph, root).plan()` / `.build(jobs, echo)`
- `BuildLayer` / `NodeContext` seams: per-node `around_node` middleware
  stack plus lifecycle events in the executor; scheduler-owned monotone
  `NodeStateTable` (node definitions are frozen)
- `IncrementalBuilder`: fingerprint-fresh nodes complete with their previous
  result (stdout replay included); deleted sources produce layer-proposed
  `rm` nodes through the insertion channel; failed outputs are removed
- Edge trigger modes: `on-success` (default, cascades skips) and
  `on-completion` (fires after success *or* failure)

Not yet implemented: cache and atomic layers, status reporting, typed
language actions, CLI helpers.

## TODO (priority order)

1. **CacheBuilder** — result store/restore keyed by the shared fingerprint;
   stdout/stderr replay; cached-failure replay.
2. **AtomicBuilder** — staging via `ctx.output_root`, commit in
   `on_build_end`, crash recovery in `on_build_begin`. Includes making
   downstream *inputs* resolve through staging (today only outputs map
   through `ctx.output_root`).
3. **Status reporting** — stale files/actions, missing outputs,
   membership-change staleness, staged-but-uncommitted state, interrupted
   atomic build needing recovery, cached failures. Build-state inspection,
   not a dry-run mode.
4. **Typed language actions** — `brix.cpp` / `brix.java` helpers that lower
   to the generic model (deferred by Duane as low-risk).
5. **CLI helpers** — `build`, `status`, `clean`, `graph`; alias→target
   mapping. Separate from `Graph` and builders.
6. **Rust engine port** — after the Python API stabilizes; then the JS/TS
   API on the same core.

Further out (from the original spec, unscheduled): graph visualization,
modular/distributed graph loading for large projects, richer change
detectors (filesystem watcher, source-control based, remote metadata),
in-memory and database-backed data expressions.

## Completed

- Minimal prototype, spec steps 1–10 plus data-set dependency inference —
  with tests, `examples/hello_text/` and `examples/raw_cpp/` both building
  end-to-end.
- `ExternalProcessAction.name` made optional.
- Build-layers design converged and documented in
  `docs/build-layers.html` (middleware + events; append-only/monotone
  ground rules; insertion channel; NodeContext logical/physical mapping;
  edge trigger modes). Rewritten in plain English with class and data-flow
  diagrams; the PDF version was dropped in favor of browser viewing.
- `freshStart.md` (the original spec) merged into this README, updated to
  the current understanding, and deleted.
- **Layer seams** (`src/brix/layers.py`): `BuildLayer` hook interface and
  `NodeContext`; the executor wraps every ready process node in the
  `around_node` stack and fires `on_build_begin` /
  `on_collection_realized` / `on_build_end`; rendering resolves inputs
  against `ctx.workspace_root` and maps outputs through `ctx.output_root`.
  Node status/result moved out of `ExecutionNode` (now frozen) into the
  scheduler-owned, monotone `NodeStateTable`. `CleanBuilder` runs with an
  empty stack; behavior unchanged.
- **Trivial-layer proof** (`tests/test_layers.py`): recording, skip-all,
  output-redirect, and stack-order layers exercised end-to-end — including
  through runtime-expanded nodes. Runnable demo: `examples/layers_demo/`
  (trace layer + hand-rolled staging-and-commit layer).
- **IncrementalBuilder part 1 — fingerprints and skip**
  (`src/brix/metadata.py`, `incremental.py`): persistent JSON metadata with
  a stat-validated file-hash cache (`TimeAndHashChangeDetector`); action
  identity keys (structure) vs fingerprints (content — command, tool
  identity, input hashes; the future cache key); fresh nodes complete with
  their previous result, stdout/stderr replay included; failed actions are
  forgotten and their outputs deleted (clean-build parity). Tests: rerun
  only what changed, byte-identical rerun keeps downstream fresh, value
  changes refingerprint, failures never replay as fresh.
- **IncrementalBuilder part 2 — deleted-source cleanup**: membership
  history per collection (applied to metadata only on build success);
  vanished members produce `DeleteFilesAction` nodes proposed by the layer
  and inserted/wired by the scheduler (`NodeProposal` — the insertion
  channel is real code now), ordered before the collection's consumers.
  Edge trigger modes landed: `on-success` (default; cascades skips) vs
  `on-completion` (fires after success or failure — for failure-triggered
  cleanup). Deletions run through the layer stack like any node.
  Runnable demo: `examples/incremental_demo/` — four builds printing how
  many processes actually spawned (4 / 0 / 2 / 1).

## Design rules

Settled — a fresh session should treat these as fixed unless Duane reopens
them:

1. **The logical graph is clean-build truth.** It never contains
   user-authored nodes for stale-output removal, failed-output deletion,
   cache lookup/restore, diagnostics replay, staging, commit, or recovery.
   Those are capabilities layered on during execution.
2. **Incremental behavior must match clean-build output.** An incremental
   build produces the same final output state a clean build would — which
   forces deleting outputs that no longer belong, deleting failed actions'
   outputs, and rebuilding downstream consistently.
3. **Layers are per-node middleware, not static plan transforms.** The plan
   grows during execution (ExpandAll), so a one-shot
   `ExecutionPlan → ExecutionPlan` rewrite misses runtime-expanded nodes.
   Instead: an `around_node` stack (innermost = process run) plus lifecycle
   events (`on_build_begin`, `on_collection_realized`, `on_build_end`).
   Stack order mirrors builder nesting: `atomic(cache(incremental(run)))`.
   Full design: `docs/build-layers.html`.
4. **Nodes are effectively immutable.** The plan is append-only (nodes and
   edges are only added, via the scheduler's single insertion channel); node
   definitions are frozen at insertion; node status is monotone
   (pending → running → done/failed/skipped). Expansion is refinement, not
   replacement; data realization is resolution (membership unknown → known),
   and the collection identity survives — it's what membership history
   attaches to across builds.
5. **Logical vs physical paths.** Declared inputs/outputs like
   `build/obj/foo.o` are logical names (used by inference, cache keys,
   membership diffs). Layers never rewrite them; `NodeContext`
   (`workspace_root`, `output_root`) maps logical → physical at render time.
6. **Cleanup is not user-authored.** Deleted-source and failed-output
   deletions are layer-proposed *real nodes*, inserted through the same
   channel as expansion. Failure-triggered cleanup uses an edge trigger
   mode: `on-success` (default) vs `on-completion`.
7. **Every shortcut is a result obtained elsewhere.** Up-to-date, cache hit,
   or process run all end in a `ProcessResult`; downstream can't tell the
   difference. Failed results are real results — cacheable, replayable, and
   they cascade normally.
8. **Cache and atomicity are independent.** Neither knows the other exists;
   atomic-outermost stack order alone routes cache-restored outputs through
   staging.
9. **One underlying model.** Typed language helpers (C++, Java, …) lower to
   the same generic action/data representation as `ExternalProcessAction`;
   raw and typed forms compose in one graph.
10. **Generated files must be representable before they exist**, and
    `ExpandAll` expands into schedulable graph nodes, not an opaque loop.
11. **Python owns user composition; Rust eventually owns the engine** —
    metadata, graph algorithms, scheduling, caching, fingerprints, and
    performance-critical execution live below the DSL boundary.

# Specification

Everything below is the reference spec (originally `freshStart.md`), updated
to match the current design.

## What Brix does

Users define build graphs in ordinary Python; the engine handles:

- content-hash-based incremental builds
- generated files
- stale output cleanup
- process result persistence
- cache lookup and restore
- stdout/stderr replay
- atomic/staged output commits
- graph visualization (future)
- status reporting

The same user graph must work unchanged under any capability combination:
clean, incremental, cached, atomic, or cached-atomic-incremental.

## Expected user file shape

A project usually has a `brix.py` with three independent responsibilities
(in any order):

1. **Capabilities** — which builder/layers are used.
2. **Dependency graph** — what data exists, what actions consume and
   produce. Clean-build truth.
3. **CLI** — parse project arguments, map aliases to targets, invoke the
   selected builder.

The target composition (builder nesting = layer stack order):

```python
def create_builder():
    change_detector = TimeAndHashChangeDetector(root=".")
    change_set = change_detector.detect_changes()

    return AtomicBuilder(
        CacheBuilder(
            IncrementalBuilder(
                change_set=change_set,
                graph_supplier=create_graph,   # callable, so the builder
            ),                                 # decides how much graph to load
            cache_dir="build/cache",
        ),
        staging_dir="build/staging",
    )
```

For a simple project that doesn't care about incremental builds:

```python
CleanBuilder(create_graph()).build()
```

Builders expose `plan() -> ExecutionPlan` and `build() -> BuildResult`.

## Logical graph model

The user declares a **logical graph** of two node families:

- **Data** — files, file collections, tools, literal values; later:
  in-memory values, database-backed sets.
- **Actions** — generic external processes, typed language actions,
  repeated-work expansion points.

A common chain is `data -> action -> data -> action -> data`, but a graph
may start with an action. The graph is not a parallel build script: it
declares what actions consume and produce, and the engine **infers**
dependency edges from data-set intersections.

## Data expressions

```python
data.file("src/main.cpp")        # one logical path (need not exist yet)
data.glob("src/{name}.cpp")      # path set with named bindings
data.regex(r"src/(?P<name>[0-9]+)\.cpp")   # for patterns glob can't express
data.tool("c++")                 # tool identity (later: path, version, …)
data.value("-O2 -std=c++20")     # literal data that affects outputs
```

- `glob` bindings match one path segment; `src/{name}.cpp` over
  `src/foo.cpp`, `src/bar.cpp` realizes to `name=foo`, `name=bar`.
- `value` exists so options/flags/env are hashable inputs without users
  creating JSON option files.
- Unions compose sets:
  `data.glob("src/{n}.cpp") + data.glob("build/generated/{n}.cpp")`.

Internally all path-like expressions lower into one interned `PathPattern`
representation (`src/brix/patterns.py`): template, binding names, compiled
matcher, literal prefix. Pattern-vs-pattern dependency inference is
conservative: provably disjoint → no edge; otherwise keep a potential edge
and resolve when a side realizes. Planned for scale: exact-path map,
prefix/segment tries, suffix buckets, matcher cache.

## Actions

### ExternalProcessAction

```python
ExternalProcessAction(
    name="compile {name}",            # optional; label falls back to command_line
    command_line="{compiler} {flags} -c {source} -o {object}",
    inputs={
        "compiler": data.tool("c++"),
        "flags": data.value("-O2"),
        "source": data.file("src/{name}.cpp"),
    },
    outputs={"object": data.file("build/obj/{name}.o")},
)
```

`command_line` is a template; placeholders refer to named inputs/outputs and
are rendered lazily (declared-but-unreferenced collections are fine). Every
run captures stdout, stderr, exit code, and termination signal as a
`ProcessResult`; results are persisted (with the incremental/cache layers)
and replayed on cache hits — cached failures replay their diagnostics and
fail the build the same way.

### Typed language actions (future)

Strongly typed, ergonomic helpers — no magic string keys:

```python
cpp.CompileSourceAction(
    source_files=data.glob("src/{name}.cpp"),
    object_files=data.glob("build/obj/{name}.o"),
    compiler=data.tool("c++"),
    compile_options=["-O2", "-std=c++20"],
)
cpp.LinkApplicationAction(
    object_files=data.glob("build/obj/{name}.o"),
    output_file=data.file("build/bin/app"),
    linker=data.tool("c++"),
)
java.JarAction(
    source_files=data.glob("src/main/java/{cls}.java"),
    output_file=data.file("build/libs/app.jar"),
    javac=data.tool("javac"), jar_tool=data.tool("jar"),
)
```

These lower to the same generic model, so raw and typed forms compose — the
proving example: a C++ tool is compiled and linked, runs to generate Java
sources, and a `JarAction` consumes
`data.glob("src/main/java/{cls}.java") + data.glob("build/generated/java/{cls}.java")`.
One graph, three kinds of action, no separate build systems.

### ExpandAll

```python
ExpandAll(
    element_name="name",
    collection=data.glob("src/{name}.cpp"),
    child=ExternalProcessAction(...),      # templated over {name}
)
```

`ExpandAll` is **not an opaque loop**. It sits in the plan as a single
unrealized node until its collection membership is known, then expands into
concrete sibling action nodes (`compile foo`, `compile bar`, …) that
schedule and run in parallel like any other node. The `ExpandAll` node
itself stays in the plan, marked done (see design rule 4).

## Generated files

The user writes a clean logical graph — a generator action whose output is
a glob, and an `ExpandAll` over that glob:

```python
graph.add(
    ExternalProcessAction(
        name="generate sources",
        command_line="{python} {generator} {csv} {out_dir}",
        inputs={...},
        outputs={"generated": data.glob("build/generated/{name}.cpp")},
    ),
    ExpandAll(
        element_name="name",
        collection=data.glob("build/generated/{name}.cpp"),
        child=ExternalProcessAction(...),
    ),
)
```

At plan time the collection and the `ExpandAll` are unrealized and the
downstream link is blocked. After `generate sources` runs, the collection
realizes, the `ExpandAll` expands, and downstream actions wait for the
concrete members. No user-declared "graph-expanding node" is needed. This
works today (see `tests/test_execution.py`).

## ExecutionPlan

The execution graph for one build invocation; may be partially realized.

Current implementation (`src/brix/plan.py`): nodes are **actions** —
`PROCESS` (concrete process) or `EXPAND` (unrealized expansion point) —
plus edges with a reason. Data expressions live on actions as declared
inputs/outputs; collections realize implicitly at expansion/render time.
(The original spec also listed realized/unrealized *data* as plan node
categories; whether data become first-class plan nodes is an open modeling
question — the ground rules in design rule 4 cover them either way.)

Current shape (per `docs/build-layers.html`):

```text
ExecutionPlan            # append-only
  nodes: [ExecutionNode] # definitions frozen at insertion
  edges: from -> to, reason, trigger: on-success | on-completion

NodeStateTable           # scheduler-owned
  node id -> status, result        # pending -> running -> done|failed|skipped
```

The scheduler owns readiness, failure cascade, and the single insertion
channel (used by both expansion and layer-proposed cleanup nodes). Nodes
execute and report results; they never mutate graph structure.

## Builders and capability layers

Root builders (`CleanBuilder`, `IncrementalBuilder`) lower the logical graph
into an `ExecutionPlan`. Capability layers (incremental, cache, atomic) are
**per-node middleware plus lifecycle events** — *not* plan-to-plan
transforms (design rule 3; full rationale and diagrams in
`docs/build-layers.html`):

```python
class BuildLayer:
    def on_build_begin(self, plan, ctx): ...          # atomic: staging/recovery
    def around_node(self, node, ctx, inner): ...      # skip / restore / redirect / run
    def on_collection_realized(self, node, members, ctx): ...  # membership diff
    def on_build_end(self, result, ctx): ...          # atomic: commit
```

- **CleanBuilder** — no change detection; may rebuild everything. Can still
  be wrapped by cache or atomic.
- **IncrementalBuilder** — takes a `ChangeSet` and a `graph_supplier`
  callable (so large projects can load only affected build modules).
  Degrades safely to clean behavior if metadata is missing; if metadata is
  missing but outputs exist, error and require explicit clean/adopt.
- **CacheBuilder** — transparent except for speed; cache key ≡ incremental
  fingerprint (one shared function over command template, tool identity,
  input hashes). Restores results and outputs, replays stdout/stderr,
  replays failures as failures.
- **AtomicBuilder** — outermost, so process outputs *and* cache-restored
  outputs go through staging. Conceptual staging:
  `build/staging/add/…` (files to add/replace) and `build/staging/del/…`
  (deletion markers). All work succeeded → commit; otherwise real outputs
  stay untouched and staged state remains inspectable for status/recovery.

## Incremental build semantics

Persistent metadata must include: file content hashes, cheap scan data
(mtime/size), action fingerprints (command/tool/options/env), discovered
dependencies, declared and extra owned outputs, generated-collection and
expansion membership, and previous process results.

The three defining scenarios:

- **Changed file** — `src/foo.cpp` changed → recompile `foo.o`, relink
  downstream.
- **Failed compile** — remove `build/obj/foo.o`, mark downstream invalid,
  remove/fail downstream outputs exactly as a clean build would have. Never
  keep a stale "last good" output the clean build wouldn't have produced.
- **Deleted source** — previous membership `{foo, bar, baz}`, current
  `{foo, bar}` → delete `build/obj/baz.o` and rebuild collection consumers.
  Requires persisted membership history; file hashes alone can never detect
  this. The deletions enter the plan as layer-proposed nodes (design
  rule 6).

## Change detection

Default: `TimeAndHashChangeDetector(root=".")` — workspace-relative paths,
timestamp/size as cheap scan, content hash when needed, ignores build
metadata directories, follows file symlinks as ordinary files, rejects
case-only path collisions. Future detectors: filesystem watcher, FUSE-like
live tracker, source-control based, remote metadata service.

## Modular build files

A graph-construction feature, orthogonal to incremental builds. Simple
projects: one `brix.py`, ordinary Python imports. Large projects (later):
`ChangeSet → DistributedGraphLoader → affected logical graph →
IncrementalBuilder`.

## CLI direction

Brix is primarily a library; projects may expose `brix.py`. CLI parsing
(`build`, `status`, `clean`, `graph`, alias→target mapping, project
arguments) stays out of `Graph` and builders.

## Class inventory

Implemented: `Graph`, `DataFactory`, `DataExpr`/`DataAtom`/`DataUnion`,
`ExternalProcessAction`, `ExpandAll`, `CleanBuilder`, `ExecutionPlan`,
`ExecutionNode`, `ExecutionEdge`, `ProcessResult`, `BuildResult`,
`PathPattern`.

Planned: `BuildLayer`, `NodeContext`, `IncrementalBuilder`, `CacheBuilder`,
`AtomicBuilder`, `ChangeSet`, `TimeAndHashChangeDetector`;
`brix.cpp.CompileSourceAction` / `LinkApplicationAction` /
`CompileApplicationAction`, `brix.java.JarAction`.

---

## Layout

The DSL layer (`src/brix/data.py`, `actions.py`, `graph.py`) is the
user-facing declaration API and stays in each host language. The engine
layer (`planner.py`, `plan.py`, `render.py`, `executor.py`, `process.py`)
consumes the logical graph and is the part scheduled to move to Rust; keep
the boundary between the two clean.

## Process notes

- Design changes: short back-and-forth discussion first; only edit docs or
  code after agreement.
- Duane is a visual guy — prefer diagrams; `docs/build-layers.html` is
  viewed directly in a browser.
- **Update this README at every commit** — move TODO items to Completed,
  reorder priorities, and record newly settled decisions.

## Quickstart

```sh
python3 -m pytest                        # run the test suite
python3 examples/hello_text/brix.py      # portable text-processing demo
python3 examples/raw_cpp/brix.py         # compile+link demo (needs c++)
python3 examples/layers_demo/brix.py     # watch the BuildLayer stack work
python3 examples/incremental_demo/brix.py  # build/rebuild/edit/delete-a-source
```

A build file looks like:

```python
from brix import CleanBuilder, ExpandAll, ExternalProcessAction, Graph

graph = Graph()
data = graph.data

graph.add(
    ExpandAll(
        element_name="name",
        collection=data.glob("src/{name}.cpp"),
        child=ExternalProcessAction(
            name="compile {name}",
            command_line="{compiler} {flags} -c {source} -o {object}",
            inputs={
                "compiler": data.tool("c++"),
                "flags": data.value("-O2 -std=c++20"),
                "source": data.file("src/{name}.cpp"),
            },
            outputs={"object": data.file("build/obj/{name}.o")},
        ),
    ),
    ExternalProcessAction(
        name="link app",
        command_line="{compiler} {objects} -o {app}",
        inputs={
            "compiler": data.tool("c++"),
            "objects": data.glob("build/obj/{name}.o"),
        },
        outputs={"app": data.file("build/bin/app")},
    ),
)

CleanBuilder(graph).build()
```
